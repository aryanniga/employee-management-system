# Employee Management System

## HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT
### FROM THE IDE
1. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse.
2. Run the DBScript in MySQL to create the database and tables.  
   (Creating database is necessary since hibernate-update option is used: `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update`)
3. If you don‚Äôt want to run the file, change  
   `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update` ‚Üí `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create-drop`  
   in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
4. Check your database connection in `application.properties` and update if needed.
5. Go to `com.employee.management`.
6. Right-click on class `Application.java`.
7. Select ‚ÄúRun As ‚Üí Java Application‚Äù in the IDE.
8. Confirm that the localhost server has started.
9. Open Postman on your system.
10. Try the URLs below to test the APIs:
   - `http://localhost:8080/employees`
   - `http://localhost:8080/departments`
